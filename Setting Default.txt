CHANNEL
uint8_t channel = 1;
Default WiFi channel that is used when starting.

DISPLAYTIMEOUT
uint32_t displayTimeout = 600
Time in seconds after which the display turns off when inactive.
To disable the display timeout, set it to 0.

MAX-CH
uint8_t maxCh = 13;
Max channel to scan on.
US = 11, EU = 13, Japan = 14.

CH-TIME
uint16_t chTime = 384;
Time for scanning one channel before going to the next in milliseconds (only if channel hopping is enabled).

MINDEAUTHS
uint16_t minDeauths = 3
Minimum number of deauthentication frames when scanning to change the LED to deauth mode.

ATTACKTIMEOUT
uint32_t attackTimeout = 600
After what amount of time (in seconds) the attack will stop automatically.
Set it to 0 to disable it.

FORCE-PACKETS
uint8_t forcePackets = 1;
How many attempts to send out a packet.
Set this value higher if you want to achieve a better packet rate in a busy area.
Be careful this setting could make the device slower or more unstable.
Max value is 255.

DEAUTHS-PER-TARGET
uint16_t deauthsPerTarget = 10;
How many deauthentication and disassociation frames are sent out for each target.

DEAUTH-REASON
uint8_t deauthReason = 1;
The reason code that is sent with the deauth frames to tell the target device why the connection will be closed.

PROBESPERSSID
uint8_t probesPerSSID = 1
How many probe request frames are sent for each SSID.
