## ESP8266 WifiPhisher
Wifiphisher can be further used to mount victim-customized web phishing attacks against the connected clients in order to capture credentials (e.g. from third party login pages or WPA/WPA2 Pre-Shared Keys) by using an inexpensive ESP8266 WiFi SoC (System On A Chip).

## Installation  
***YOU ONLY NEED TO DO ONE OF THE INSTALLATION METHODS!***

#### 1.Uploading the .bin files 
* recommended! Tutorials are available on youtube
#### 2.Compiling the source with Arduino
First you have to install and open the Arduino IDE.
* Add the required libraries
* In Arduino go to File -> Preferences add both URLs in Additional Boards Manager URLs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpacehuhnTech/arduino/main/package_spacehuhn_index.json
* Go to Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager, search "deauther" and install Deauther ESP8266 Boards
* Select your board at Tools -> Board and be sure it is at Deauther ESP8266 Boards (and not at ESP8266 Modules)!
* Download the source code for this project from the releases page. You can also clone the project to get the latest changes, but you will also get the latest bugs ;)
* Extract the whole .zip file, and open ESP8266-WifiPhisher.ino with Arduino.
* Check your upload settings and press upload!

## Under Development
Currently, the ESP8266 WifiPhisher has limited software capabilities. New firmware features will be added over time and will eventually reach the point where this project becomes the smallest hacking machine.
